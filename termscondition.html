            <p>
              Red Hat, Inc. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries
              (collectively, “Red Hat”) respect your privacy. This Privacy
              Statement applies to personal data collected by Red Hat through
              the redhat.com website, and other websites which we operate and on
              which we post a direct link to this Privacy Statement. For some
              websites managed by Red Hat affiliates, the affiliate may act as a
              controller for data collected from the website. This Privacy
              Statement may not apply to open source project websites sponsored
              by Red Hat. Such project websites may have their own privacy
              statements, which we encourage you to review. In certain cases,
              this Privacy Statement applies to personal data collected by Red
              Hat when Red Hat makes this Privacy Statement or a link to the
              Privacy Statement available in a digital communication, paper form
              or in person (for example when attending an event). Please also
              note that co-branded websites (websites where Red Hat presents
              content together with one or more of our business partners) may be
              governed by additional or different privacy statements. Please
              refer to the privacy statement on those websites for more
              information about applicable privacy practices. Red Hat’s
              obligations with respect to personal data that may be held on
              behalf of customers in connection with cloud services Red Hat
              provides, such as personal data stored by customers using our
              OpenShift Online offering, are defined in our agreements with our
              customers and are not governed by this Privacy Statement. As used
              in this Privacy Statement, “personal data” means any information
              that relates to, is capable of being associated with, describes,
              or could be linked to, an identified or identifiable natural
              person (‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who
              can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
              reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification
              number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more
              factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
              economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

                Red Hat may disclose personal data to business partners and
                service providers in order to support our business operations,
                such as (but not limited to) fulfilling your orders, following
                up on requests, providing support and assisting Red Hat with
                sales, marketing and communication initiatives. These business
                partners and service providers include distributors, resellers,
                payment processors, financial service providers and
                institutions, materials production and shipping companies,

                by contract to keep the information received on behalf of Red
                Hat confidential and secure and not use it for any purpose other
                than the purpose for which it was provided to them.

                  The categories of personal data we may disclose to these third

                Red Hat may disclose personal data as required by law or legal
                process, such as responding to a duly authorized and lawful

                transaction involving part or all of Red Hat, such as a merger,
                acquisition, consolidation, or divestiture. Such a transaction
                may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or
                actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Red
                Hat’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in
                these types of transactions. Red Hat will inform you of the name
                and the contact information of the receiver of your personal
                data. Following such a business transaction, you may contact the

              We do not sell personal data as the term sell is commonly
              understood. Under certain Data Protection Laws, a “sale” is
              defined to include disclosures of personal data to a third party
              for monetary or valuable consideration. When you use Red Hat
              websites, Red Hat’s authorized partners, such as advertising
              networks, data analytics providers, social networks and
              advertising partners, may collect cookies and similar technology
              and use this data (such as your Internet or other similar network
              activity) for their own purposes, such as improving their own
              services. This activity may qualify as a “sale” under applicable
              Data Protection Laws. You can make choices to allow or prevent
              such uses (see the Cookies and Other Technology section below on

                Hat also uses functional cookies to improve our service to you

              enable, disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually
              located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility). If a
              cookie manager has been implemented by Red Hat on the website you
              are visiting, the cookie tool will be displayed on the website
              during your visit (e.g., click the “Cookie Preferences” or similar
              link at the bottom of the website). You can use the cookie manager
              to set your cookie preference and to see a list of the cookies
              used on the Red Hat website. The cookie manager also provides
              information on the specific cookies used and the classification of
              the cookie (i.e., Required, Functional or Advertising). Whether
              you utilize the cookie manager or manage cookies at the individual
              browser level, please remember that Required cookies will remain
              and cannot be turned off. Please also understand that choosing to
              reject cookies may reduce the performance and functionality of our
              websites. Red Hat also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction
              with cookies to compile information about usage of our websites
              and interaction with emails from Red Hat (e.g., open rates, click
              through rates). Web beacons are clear electronic images that can
              recognize certain types of information on your device, such as
              cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web
              beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For
              example, Red Hat may place web beacons in marketing emails that
              notify Red Hat when you click on a link in the email that directs
              you to one of our websites. Red Hat uses web beacons to operate
              and improve our websites and email communications.

              consent that you have previously provided to us, you may do so via
              our Personal Data Request Form. However, the withdrawal of consent
              will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent
              before its withdrawal. Where the applicable Data Protection Laws
              do not apply, Red Hat grants you the ability to access, modify, or
              update some of your personal data online at any time. You may log

              your contact information, your general preferences, and your
              personalization settings. If necessary, you may also contact us
              via our Personal Data Request Form and describe the changes you
              want made to the information you have previously provided.
              However, note that changing or deleting information necessary for
              Red Hat to assist with support, services, and purchases may result
              in a delay or interruption in processing your requests. You will
              be given an opportunity to tell us whether you would like to
              receive information, special offers, and promotional materials by
              email from Red Hat or our business partners when you create a
              redhat.com account, when you register for a service, when you
              provide us with your personal data, or when we send you a
              marketing email. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain
              adequate consent to provide you with these marketing materials.
              You also have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing emails
              from Red Hat at any time without cost by clicking on the relevant
              link contained in our marketing emails or by contacting us via our
              Personal Data Request Form. You can also exercise your rights and
              choices by contacting us as described below under “How to contact
              us.” When you exercise your privacy rights, such as those
              conferred by the applicable Data Protection Laws, you have a right
              not to receive discriminatory treatment by Red Hat for the
              exercise of such privacy rights.

            <p>
              Before responding to a request for information about your personal
              data, we must verify the request. Verification is important to
              protect your information and to help confirm that we are
              responding to a valid request and providing the response to the
              correct individual. To verify the request we initially ask for at
              least two (2) or three (3) identifiers, such as name, email
              address and location. If we have a need to request additional
              identifiers to reasonably verify your identity, we will contact
              you and request additional verification. The information we ask to
              verify your identity may depend on your relationship with us.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you exercise your privacy rights under the applicable Data
              Protection Laws, you can designate an authorized agent or
              representative to make a request on your behalf by providing the
              authorized agent with written permission to do so and verifying
              your identity with us as part of the request, or by providing the
              authorized agent with Power of Attorney pursuant to applicable law
              (e.g., the California Probate code). We will ask the individual
              submitting the request to denote that they are an authorized agent
              or representative. When submitted by an authorized agent or
              representative, we ask the authorized agent or representative to
              provide name, email address and a description of the relationship
              with the individual who is the subject of the request and to
              certify that the representative has permission to submit the
              request, and may request proof of the consumer’s written
              permission.
